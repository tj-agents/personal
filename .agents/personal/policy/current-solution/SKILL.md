# Personal projects

These rules are mandatory in projects that explicitly adopt `personal@tj-agents`. Adoption records the
project's personal scope; a home directory, author name or employer association never establishes it.
Employer projects remain outside this profile unless Tommy explicitly changes that scope.

Keep one current supported solution. When replacing behavior, remove the superseded names, aliases,
fallback implementations, adapters, configuration formats and compatibility branches. Coordinate and
migrate all known callers, project declarations, installed registrations, generated artifacts and live
runtime entry points in the same cutover. Do not retain obsolete behavior for hypothetical external users;
coordinate upgrades with the actual collaborating developers.

Verify the entry points people actually use on every supported platform, including Windows and Linux
launch paths where supported. Source edits, successful generation, passing unit tests and version commands
alone do not prove that a migration is complete. Check installed bindings and fresh runtime behavior.
Record any unverified entry point as incomplete, with its resolver and observable acceptance condition.

Do not independently add a backwards-compatibility exception. Surface an explicit contrary user requirement
as a deliberate policy decision, identify the affected supported behavior and reconcile this profile's
scope before implementing it. Never hide an exception in a fallback or adapter.

Solve the demonstrated problem with the smallest suitable implementation. Add abstractions, dependencies,
configuration switches, duplicate paths or process machinery only for a concrete current need. Prefer the
capabilities the project already selects. Verify the behavior and meaningful failure paths in proportion
to the change; do not add tests that merely repeat the implementation or a checklist with no concrete benefit.

This policy is authored once here. Personal adoption generates its marked native instruction block from
this body and checks it for drift. A selected plugin or an `always` tier alone is not proof of loading.
